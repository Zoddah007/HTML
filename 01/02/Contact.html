        The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the premier professional basketball league in the world, with a rich history dating back to its founding in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The league adopted its current name in 1949 after merging with the National Basketball League (NBL).

The NBA is composed of 30 teams, with 29 in the United States and one in Canada. These teams are divided into two conferences, the Eastern and Western, and further split into three divisions each. The regular season, which runs from October to April, is followed by a playoff tournament that culminates in the NBA Finals.

Over the years, the NBA has evolved from a national league into a global phenomenon, attracting top talent from all over the world and captivating millions of fans with its fast-paced action, iconic rivalries, and superstar players like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry.
